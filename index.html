                <span class="about-text">When I was young I loved to take things apart to try and figure out how they went together.
                    I've always thought it was so cool that people were able to come up with these designs, and it made me want to try it out myself.<br><br>
                    As I got older I started working on computers and learning how to use them, and I realized they could let me build an infinite number of creations.<br><br>
                    Respect and enjoyment for the process, and making sure the end result is exactly what I want is one of the most important parts to me,
                    and I love the freedom programming has given me.
